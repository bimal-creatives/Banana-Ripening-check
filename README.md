# Banana-Ripening-check
Use of Machine learning and Image processing for checking the ripening stage of a banana

**Motivation**

As the world becomes more machine learning oriented, it can be seen that many of the jobs done by humans will be done by robots. The robotic revolution will be infinite from the most complex tasks such as surgeries to the simplest task such as moving objects, everything will be done by robots.
Machines have already been integrated into our world. Companies are using robots to identify parcels and other deliveries. Amazon wants to use image processing, machine learning and drone technologies to control this system.
As engineers of the future generation, we decided to employ these technologies to try and emulate the technology on a smaller scale. We decided to make this system using image processing for analysing if the banana is ripe or unripe. We used machine learning in the form of clustering to train the system based on a dataset we collected of different pictures of different bananas at different ripening stages 

## Running the tests

* run the dataSetGenerator.py 
* run trainer.py
* run detector.py
* run IPcode.py to run an Image processing for checking the ripening stage of a banana
